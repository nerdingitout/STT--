tell
me
about
your
day

time
do
you
wake
up
well
let's
see
%HESITATION
some
days
I
wake
up
early
maybe
about
six
o'clock
yeah
sometimes
I
wake
up
at
six
o'clock
when
I
get
up
early
I
like
to
get
ready
for
the
day
take
a
shower
and
have
breakfast
but
other
day
is
I
don't
like
getting
up
early
maybe
I'll
sleep
in
until
ten
or
eleven
%HESITATION
yeah
I
like
sleeping
in
late
it
so
sometimes
I
wake
up
at
eleven
on
those
days
if
I
know
I
won't
wake
up
until
eleven
I'll
take
a
shower
the
night
before
before
I
go
to
bed
how
bout
you
Serra
when
do
you
usually
wake
up
well
I
like
every
day
to
be
the
same
%HESITATION
I
wake
up
every
day
at
eight
o'clock
eight
eight
and
I
always
do
the
same
thing
first
I
make
coffee
right
away
then
I
wake
up
my
kids
and
we
have
breakfast
together
at
about
eight
thirty
really
yes
we
usually
have
something
easy
like
bread
and
yogurt
and
fruit
I
like
to
have
coffee
every
morning
whether
I
wake
up
at
six
or
at
ten
I'm
still
going
to
have
coffee
but
I
often
skip
breakfast
do
you
always
eat
breakfast
every
day
yes
if
I
don't
eat
breakfast
I'm
so
hungry
what
about
lunch
what
time
do
you
have
lunch
lunch
is
the
same
every
day
for
me
I
always
eat
lunch
at
twelve
thirty
PM
so
%HESITATION
whenever
I
wake
up
I
do
some
things
and
then
I
always
have
lunch
at
twelve
thirty
PM
%HESITATION
just
half
past
noon
and
I
always
have
a
simple
lunch
maybe
some
soup
or
spaghetti
or
a
sandwich
something
like
and
it's
always
at
half
past
noon
what
time
do
eat
lunch
that's
interesting
I
have
breakfast
at
the
same
time
every
day
but
lunch
is
always
at
a
different
time
really
because
I'm
busy
in
the
morning
I
go
out
maybe
I
go
shopping
sometimes
I
clean
the
house
so
I
might
have
lunch
at
eleven
o'clock
or
twelve
o'clock
sometimes
as
late
as
two
thirty
%HESITATION
%HESITATION
it's
getting
late
yes
but
it's
always
a
easy
lunch
like
you
maybe
crackers
and
she
is
or
a
sandwich
or
a
baked
potato
